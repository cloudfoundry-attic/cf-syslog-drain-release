  properties:
  - scalablesyslog.adapter.port

properties:
  scalablesyslog.adapter.health:
    description: The port for the adapter health endpoint.
    default: 8080
  scalablesyslog.adapter.pprof:
    description: The port for pprof on the adapter.
    default: 0

  scalablesyslog.adapter.port:
    description: The port for the adapter to listen on gRPC.
    default: 4443
  scalablesyslog.adapter.logs.addr:
    description: |
      The address of the Reverse Log Proxy (RLP) if Bosh DNS is not enabled.
    default: "reverse-log-proxy.service.cf.internal:8082"
  scalablesyslog.adapter.bosh_dns:
    description: Enable Bosh DNS. Disabling this implies Consul DNS.
    default: false
  scalablesyslog.adapter.keepalive:
    description: |
      The duration for sending keepalive packets for TCP and TLS syslog
      drains. Setting this to zero disables keepalives.
    default: 30s
  scalablesyslog.adapter.syslog_dial_timeout:
    description: The timeout duration for dialing syslog drains.
    default: 5s
  scalablesyslog.adapter.syslog_io_timeout:
    description: The timeout duration for writing to syslog drains.
    default: 1m
  scalablesyslog.adapter.syslog_skip_cert_verify:
    description: |
      This disables TLS verification when connecting to a HTTPS or a Syslog TLS drain.
    default: false
  scalablesyslog.adapter.metrics_to_syslog_enabled:
    description: |
      By setting this value to true, the adapter will support writing
      metrics into a syslog drain. Note, this feature requires Loggregator
      v101 or higher.
    default: false

  scalablesyslog.adapter.tls.ca:
    description: |
      When the adapter accepts connections via gRPC it must validate the
      clients' certificates were signed by a trusted CA. This is the CA
      trusted by the adapter.
  scalablesyslog.adapter.tls.cert:
    description: |
      This certificate is sent to gRPC clients when they initiate a connection.
      It must be signed by a CA that is trusted by the client.
  scalablesyslog.adapter.tls.key:
    description: |
      This is the private key for the certificate sent to gRPC clients when
      they initiate a connection.
  scalablesyslog.adapter.tls.cn:
    description: |
      This value is deprecated and not needed any longer.
    default: ""

  scalablesyslog.adapter_rlp.tls.ca:
    description: |
      When the adapter communicates with the RLP it must validate the
      RLP's certificates were signed by a trusted CA. This is the CA
      trusted by the adapter for that communication.
  scalablesyslog.adapter_rlp.tls.cert:
    description: |
      This certificate is sent to the RLP when initiating a connection.
      It must be signed by a CA that is trusted by the RLP.
  scalablesyslog.adapter_rlp.tls.key:
    description: |
      This is the private key for the certificate sent to the RLP when
      initiating a connection.
  scalablesyslog.adapter_rlp.tls.cn:
    description: |
      When the adapter communicates with the RLP it must validate the RLP's
      common name (CN) or subject alternative names (SANs) against the hostname
      or IP address used to initiate the connection. Since we use a custom CN
      for RLP this must be set to that value for validation to be successful.

  scalablesyslog.metric_ingress_addr:
    description: |
      The address used to send metric data to metron.
    default: localhost:3458
  scalablesyslog.metric_ingress_cn:
    description: |
      When the adapter communicates with metron it must validate metron's
      common name (CN) or subject alternative names (SANs) against the
      hostname or IP address used to initiate the connection. Since we use a
      custom CN for metron this must be set to that value for validation to be
      successful.
    default: metron

  metric_emitter.interval:
    description: The interval that metrics are emitted to metron.
    default: 1m
